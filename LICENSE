Additional Terms per GNU AGPL v3 §7 — Attribution and UI Legal Notices

As a supplement permitted by §7(b)–(c), any covered work that includes an interactive user interface must preserve the following author attribution in its Appropriate Legal Notices:
- The ORAI Solutions logo

This requirement is satisfied if the user interface provides an "About" or "Credits" section that is clearly labeled and accessible from the main menu or settings within at most two user interactions (clicks/taps). The attribution may be moved but not removed, obscured, or disabled. Modified versions must retain these notices and may add statements that they are modified versions.

Use of the ORAI name and logo is subject to applicable trademark law; this license does not grant trademark rights beyond this attribution requirement. Nothing in these additional terms is intended to impose further restrictions on recipients’ exercise of rights under the GNU AGPL v3.
